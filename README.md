# Blowfish-Algorithm-
This Verilog project implements the Blowfish encryption and decryption algorithm through two main modules: Blowfishencrypt and BlowfishDecrypt. The Blowfishencrypt module takes a 64-bit plaintext input and a 128-bit key to generate a 64-bit ciphertext. It uses an internal structure that includes a P-array and four S-boxes, which are initialized with predefined constants and XORed with the key to generate subkeys. The encryption process involves 16 rounds of a Feistel network, where data is manipulated using the subkeys and S-boxes. The module also outputs intermediate values, temp_out and F_out, which provide insights into the encryption process.

The BlowfishDecrypt module performs the reverse operation. It takes a 64-bit ciphertext and the same 128-bit key to recover the original 64-bit plaintext. Like the encryption module, it initializes a P-array and S-boxes, generating subkeys by XORing them with the key. The decryption process also involves 16 rounds of a Feistel network, but the operations are reversed to retrieve the original data. Additionally, the module outputs an intermediate subkey value, subkey_word_out, used during the decryption process.

This design is modular and easy to understand, with encryption and decryption separated into distinct modules. This approach makes it easier to maintain and extend the code, while also ensuring that the implementation adheres to the principles of the Blowfish algorithm.
